## Enjoy Generation! ðŸ˜Š

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue in this repository.

## Why
I chose OpenAI because it provided a smooth experience with obtaining and handling requests for the initial version.

## UE Slate
Sorry for the not very modular Slate code (first time... next will be better ;) )

## TODO:
- Check if api key is valid and if not ask user to insert it
- Show created texture in plugin window
- Create checkbox if original PNG should be deleted
- Add more models
- Add style switcher
- Handle more edge cases
- Give users choice of texture parameters
- Give users ability to change the folder where textures will be saved
- Add images to README for better readability
- Add switcher for how many versions of images should be generated
